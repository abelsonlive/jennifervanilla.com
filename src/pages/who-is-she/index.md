## Who Is She?

Jennifer Vanilla is the entrepreneurial fantasy vessel LARP-ed into reality by Becca Kauffman, a New York City performance artist and long-standing member of art rock band, Ava Luna. Her commercial-inspired vocalizations, paired with reconstructions (or "jv edits") of 90's house tracks, are inflected with homages to Will Powers, Ann Steel, and Laurie Anderson, and provide the foundation for her comedic motivational live performances.

JV has performed at MoMA PS1, Bowery Ballroom, Elsewhere, Practice Gallery, The Sound Hole, and has a permanent residency at The Windjammer Theater in Ridgewood, Queens. She has shared bills with Yaeji, Of Montreal, YACHT, Cindy Wilson of The B-52's, Miho Hatori's New Optimism, David Liebe Hart, Julianna Barwick, Helado Negro, comedians Julio Torres, Ana Fabrega, Joe Pera, Jaboukie Young-White, and Lorelei Ramirez. A contempo clown who uses attention as her business model, she'll sell you back to yourself for free. She is currently an artist in residence in Times Square.

If you're going to have a fantasy, at least make it reality. If you're going to have reality, at least make it a fantasy." - Jennifer Vanilla
